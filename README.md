# **Encryption Algorithm for Password Protection**

This repository contains an **encryption algorithm** designed to securely encrypt passwords. The algorithm has been tested and passed the following criteria:

- **3 NIST Randomness Tests**
- **Brute Force Test**
- **Avalanche Score Test**

## **Features**

- **Strong Encryption**: The algorithm uses advanced encryption techniques to ensure secure password storage.
- **Randomness**: The encryption method has been tested and passed the **3 NIST randomness tests** to ensure unpredictable outputs.
- **Brute Force Resistance**: The algorithm is designed to withstand brute force attacks, making it resilient to common password-cracking methods.
- **Avalanche Effect**: The algorithm shows a high avalanche score, ensuring that even small changes in the input result in significantly different outputs.
